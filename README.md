# Aba agent-based helper

Aba makes it easier to install OpenShift onto vSphere or ESXi (or onto bare-metal) using the Agent-based installer.
It helps you generate valid agent-based configuration files and then, using those files, to create matching VMs in vSphere or ESXi. 

Run the following for instructions:

```
bin/aba -h 
```
