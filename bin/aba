		Usage: `basename $0` [--debug] <command> --dir <directory> 

		If the directory does not exist it will be created and configuration files added.
		The configuration files need to be edited to match your environment. 
		If needed, edit the configuration files and run the command again. 

		Example:
		  `basename $0` reg init
		  `basename $0` --dir compact 

		Commands:

		reg init          Install and initialize a mirror registry on the local host (bastion).
		reg delete|del    Uninstall the mirror registry.

		vmw upload	  Upload the ISO image to vSphere or ESXi.
		vmw create        Create the VMs using the config files (install-config.yaml and agent-config.yaml).
		vmw stop          Power down the VMs.
		vmw start         Power on the VMs.
		vmw refresh       Delete and re-create the VMs.
		monitor           View the installation progress on the rendezvous server after the agent service has started

		reset             Delete the generated files.
