The 'aba.conf' file, contains some values that you will want to change, e.g. your domain name, your network address etc.

Now run one of the two following options (1 or 2) to configure the registry and download the needed software.

1) For a 'connected' installation:

make sync                     # Run on a 'connected bastion', to load the registry directly from the Internet.

2) For a dissconnected (or air-gapped) installation:

make save                     # First, run on a 'connected bastion', to 'save' the images from the Internet to local disk. 
make tar out=/path/to/drive   # Archive the *whole repo* to a thumb drive.  Extract the tarball onto the internal bastion. 
make load                     # Run on a 'disconnected bastion' to load the saved images into a registry from the thumb drive.

See the README file for more information.

After the mirror registry is working and loaded, run one of the following to install OpenShift: 

make sno                      # Warning: first edit the template file templates/cluster-sno.conf to match your environment
make compact                  # Warning: first edit the template file templates/cluster-compact.conf to match your environment
make standard                 # Warning: first edit the template file templates/cluster-standard.conf to match your environment
make cluster name=mycluster   # This will set up a standard cluster and allow you to edit the cluster.conf configuration file.
