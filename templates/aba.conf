ocp_channel=stable		# The channel to use to install OpenShift ('stable', 'fast', 'candidate' or 'eus').
ocp_version=4.17.18		# Target OpenShift version. See https://console.redhat.com/openshift/releases for available versions.
				# See https://console.redhat.com/openshift/releases for more.

platform=bm			# Possible values: 'vmw' (vCenter or ESXi) or 'bm' (bare-metal). 'bm' will skip VM creation. 
pull_secret_file=~/.pull-secret.json	# Write your Red Hat registry pull secret to this file path. Only used for downloading images.
					# Download from: https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads#tool-pull-secret
editor=vi                       # The editor to use, e.g. nano.  Set to 'none' to allow manual edit of all config files.
ask=true			# Prompt before major changes, e.g. VM/Cluster deletion, cluster installation etc. 

# Set the following values *if they are already known*:

op_sets=			# Optional: Add sets of operators, e.g. op_sets=odf,ocpv,acm,mesh2 to the imageset file.
				# Sets of operators are defined in the files: 'templates/operator-set-*'. Change or add your own.
				# Possible values are: ocp,acm,ocpv,odf,appdev,mesh2,mesh3,odfdr,quay,sec
				# Special value 'all' will enable all operators to be downloaded! (Ensure enough disk space!)

ops=				# Optional: Add individual operators, e.g. ops=web-terminal,node-healthcheck-operator

domain=example.com              # The base domain name you want to use for OpenShift.
machine_network=10.0.0.0/20	# OpenShift will be installed into this private network (use CIDR format).
dns_servers=10.0.1.8,10.0.2.8   # Your DNS server(s) (comma separated).
next_hop_address=10.0.1.1       # Your private network's default route IP.
ntp_servers=10.0.1.8,10.0.2.8	# Optional: Configure NTP during bootstrap. Required if platform clock not synchronized!
				# Note: the above 5 values can be overridden later in 'cluster.conf', if needed.

# Only change below values if you know what you're doing!

verify_conf=true		# Verify syntax of values in config files

oc_mirror_version=v2		# v1 of "oc-mirror" is the default version to use.  v2, which had been tested with aba, is:
				# "still under development and is almost production ready" (as of 22 Feb 2025) - now GA with version 4.18
				# *You must set "oc_mirror_version=v2" if you are seeing errors, e.g.:
				#   "manifest type *ocischema.DeserializedImageIndex is not supported"
				#   See: https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-44103 & https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7107286 for more.
				# IMPORTANT NOTES FOR V2 OF OC-MIRROR (3 FEB 2025):
				# - If you hit the above bug* in v1, try to use v2.
				# - v2 does not handle operator dependencies the same way as v1.  You will need to add ALL
				#   operator dependencies into the image set config file yourself.
				#   Example: 'web-terminal' depends on 'devworkspace-operator' so it is included in the op. set file: 'templates/operator-set-ocp'
				# - v2 does not report errors in the same way as v1.  You will need to be sure all
				#   required operators have been properly copied to Quay.  Aba will do its best to help you!
				# - You must copy over the image set config (yaml) file *as well as* the image set archive (tar) files to 
				#   the internal bastion, since oc-mirror needs the yaml file to load the images.  Aba will assist you on this too.
